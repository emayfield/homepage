# About Us

The Cherry Avenue Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, located in Pittsburgh, PA, aiming to support the structural, social, and institutional growth of individuals and organizations who have been shut out or prevented from accessing traditional sources of investment, funding, and wealth. Our goal is to help those individuals and organizations improve themselves and their communities. 

We are especially excited to support grantees that focus on solving a specific, clear problem that is relatively deprioritized by other funders. We are hoping to support specialization, giving to organizations who know exactly what their community needs, and can expertly fill narrow gaps.

Grantees should be locally based in, and comprised of members from, the community they serve. We want to fund groups that can get supplies and support to people without “swooping in” to help from the outside. We fund groups who have built trust within their own community.
