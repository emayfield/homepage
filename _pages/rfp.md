## Grant Areas

In our second year we are funding grants in the following areas:

* **General Operating Support** to support a pre-existing organization doing good work. This money can pay your salaries, rent, professional fees, and equipment costs for the work that you are already doing in your community in 2021 and 2022.

* **One-Time Projects** to support a single idea that you or your organization has always wanted to do, but could never prioritize in your budget. Projects should be completed before the end of 2022, with no additional maintenance costs required in future years.

* **Long-Term Projects** to get an idea off the ground that needs an initial burst of funding. These projects should be new to your organization, but you expect them to continue requiring financial support beyond 2022 as part of a longer-term vision.

## Grant Sizes

We are soliciting grant requests in three sizes:

* **Introductory** grants of up to $10,000 for organizations that have less of a proven track record and are still working out the specifics of how they can be most successful.

* **Full** grants of up to $50,000 for organizations with paid full-time staff, ongoing projects, and a history of effectively getting work done in their community.

* **Commitment** grants of up to $500,000, distributed over three years, for organizations that have previously received Cherry Avenue Foundation funding and can make progress with the financial support for a longer-term plan.

## Eligibility

Individual grants shall be based on merit, but need may also be a factor. In no event may race or religion be a factor in determining whether an applicant is qualified for a grant.

No activities attempting to influence legislation, or participating in any political campaign on behalf of, or in opposition to, any candidate for public office.

Two categories of recipient are eligible:

* **Charitable Organizations:** Tax exempt charities entitled to exemption from federal income tax under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.

* **Individuals with charitable purposes:** Individuals may make specific requests for funding so long as they adhere to the religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
